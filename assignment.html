<h1><b> My assignment.html page for linking to assignment items described in Assignment and Report Specifications</b></h1>
<p><br></p>
<p>This page is the marking guide to your website that your tutor will use to find your elements.  Do not name this page anything other than assignment.html (all lower case) or else we may not be able to find and mark your assignment elements.<span>&nbsp; </span>How to use this page:</p>
<ul>
  <li>upload this assignment.html file in your website directory during part 2.3 of Lab 1</li>
  <li>later, link this page to your website's index.html page</li>
  <li>over time, link each assignment task listed below to its location in your website as soon as you have started it</li>
  <li>replace the "notes" paragraph with your notes or
delete if you have no notes - your notes will help us understand and
mark your site so you should explain things. Maybe you did a task
differently from the way we specified it, either because your way is
better (tell us) or minimally or not at all to fit in with your site's
look and feel (tell us) or ... (also tell us). So, for example, a video
might spoil the look and feel. What you do is make one anyway, link to
it from this assessment.html page and explain in the <i>Notes</i> why
it's not linked to from your public version of your web site. You can
style this page as your like, so long as you keep the links to the
assignment tasks.</li>
  <li>provide details for your best student forums posts where indicated</li>
  <li>provide the date you attended the continuous improvement session where indicated</li>
  <li>provide link to report where indicated</li>
  <li>delete these instructions when you are ready</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h1><b>1.0 Part 1 Tasks</b></h1>
<h2><b>1.2 Your <i>Me and My Passion</i></b></h2>
<!-- <p>Replace this line with your URL link to this element in your website.</p> -->
<a href="index.html">Main page link (Kind of like My Passion)</a>
<!-- <p>Notes: Provide any notes you may have about this element here.</p> -->
<p>
  <b>IMPORTANT: To save a lot of time, I only left detailed comments on the main page,
  only on the elements that have not appeared before. The rest of the pages will only
  have comments where something new is introduced.</b><br>
  Notes: Because I chose a topic that is not directly tied to me, there is not a lot about me
  personally. I do give my opinion on the matter, but not much more. Still, it is a valid
  overview/main page.
</p>

<h2><b>1.3 CSS</b></h2>
<!-- <p>Replace this line with your URL link to this element in your website.</p> -->
<a href="implementation.html">
  Page with example of CSS</a>
<br>
<a href="Styles/Neumorphism/NeuBox.css">
  The most important CSS file (It contains outset box styling,
  which is the main feature of most of the elements on the page).</a>
<!-- <p>Notes: Provide any notes you may have about this element here.</p> -->
<p>
  Notes: Because of how much CSS the website uses, most files contain minimal commenting
  (otherwise the comment clutter would get too heavy),
  just whole element descriptions. This particular page has more detailed commenting to
  demonstrate that I understand what I'm doing.
</p>

<h2><b>1.4 Site Map</b></h2>
<!-- <p>Replace this line with your URL link to this element in your website.</p> -->
<a href="sitemap.html">Link to Sitemap</a>
<!-- <p>Notes: Provide any notes you may have about this element here.</p> -->
<p>
  Notes: This is the sitemap page. However, the main website navigation is
  done through the header nav as well as helper buttons at the bottom of each page.
  The sitemap is more detailed though.
</p>


<h2><b>1.5 Source Log</b></h2>
<!-- <p>Replace this line with your URL link to this element in your website.</p> -->
<a href="sourcelog.html">Link to Sourcelog</a>
<!-- <p>Notes: Provide any notes you may have about this element here.</p> -->
<p>
  There are not that many images, most of the website relies on my own CSS.
</p>

<h2><b>1.6 Feedback Form</b></h2>
<!-- <p>Replace this line with your URL link to this element in your website.</p> -->
<a href="feedback.html">Link to Feedback</a>
<!-- <p>Notes: Provide any notes you may have about this element here.</p> -->
<p>
  The page uses placeholders instead of labels to minimise useless text.

<h1><b>2.0 Part 2 Tasks</b></h1>
<h2><b>2.1 Image Map</b></h2>
<!-- <p>Replace this line with your URL link to this element in your website.</p> -->
<a href="appeal.html#map-anchor">Click the image parts</a>
<p>The map coords is dynamically resized using a JS script.</p>
<h2><b>2.2 Photo Gallery</b></h2>
<!-- <p>Replace this line with your URL link to this element in your website.</p> -->
<a href="gallery.html">Gallery page</a>
<p>The images have been converted to PNG scaled down to
  25% width and height, because in PNG their size becomes monstrous. 
  Their full versions in JPEG are available by clicking on them.
</p>

<h2><b>2.3 &amp; 2.4 Storyboard + Video / Javascript</b></h2>
<p>I have 3 JS files that each serve a specific purpose in the website.<br>
All of them are worthy of marking, so here is the list. Ideally please look
through all of them.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="Scripts/ImageMapScaler.js">Script that scales image map coordinates when the size of the image is changed</a> - This is the
  most impressive one, use it if you can only marl one</li>

  <li><a href="Scripts/Accessibility.js">Accessibility plaque functionality</a></li>
<li><a href="Scripts/DropDownNav.js">Dynamic nav bar functionality</a></li>
</ul>
<!-- <p>I am doing storyboard/video (delete one so we know which to mark)</p>

<h1><b>3.0 Part 3 Tasks</b></h1>
<h2>About comments</h2>
<p>
  Please note that in this assignment part no new CSS was added. The new HTML does not have any comments, because I only use concepts that were already explained in previous assignments, and commenting thousands of lines of repetitive HTML would just create clutter. As a replacement, you can head to the <a href="documentation.html">documentation page</a> to see for yourself the explanation of every element on this website.
</p>
<h2><b>3.1 Reflections</b></h2>
<a href="reflection.html">My experience when making this website</a>
<!-- <p>Replace this line with your URL link to this element in your website.</p>
<p>Notes: Provide any notes you may have about this element here.</p> -->
<h2><b>3.2 Alternative CSS</b></h2>
<p>
  II have an accessibility mode that can be toggled with a button.<br>
  For example, visit <a href="index.html">the Main page</a>. You won't miss it - it's a labelled checkbox in the top-left.<br>
  Here is the link to the <a href="Scripts/Accessibility.js">JS file that toggles the accessibility mode</a>, as well as <br><a href="Styles/Neumorphism/Accessibility.css">the CSS file itself</a>.
</p>
  
<p>As a bonus, I have multiple color schemes for all of the pages. Each scheme only changes the variables for the main stylesheet. It is explained a bit more thoroughly <a href="documentation.html#p-colors">on the documentation page</a>. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="index.html">Light theme</a></li>
  <li><a href="implementation.html">Dark theme</a></li>
  <li><a href="library.html">Pink theme</a></li>
</ul>

<h2><b>3.3 Social Networking Button(s)</b></h2>
<p>
  In the new verion of the website, every single footer has a few social media links. For example, here is the <a href="index.html#index-footer">the footer on the main page</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Note: The buttons are embedded using the documentation linked on the lab document. Twitter button is literally a link, they do not havea specific script. Other ones are JS inserts that generate the button. The entire panel is scaled up using translate, because the buttons were originaly too small.

<h2><b>3.6 Something Original</b></h2>
<a href="library.html">A CSS library</a> and <a href="documentation.html">the corresponding documentation</a>
<p>
  Since my website is entirely dedicated to Neumorphism style and its CSS implementation, and is built entirely from scratch using that very style, it makes sense to provide the visitor with a ready-for-use downloadable library so that they can try the style they're reading about for themselves. On top of that, the documentation makes sure they don't have to go plowing through hundreds or maybe thousands of lines of my CSS (didn't count) to find the specific feature they need.
