                <p><b>Well I have something for you.</b><br>
                    Look at the buttons to the right. Don't you just want to touch them, feel the
                    sensation of those slight bevels? If so, you will enjoy Neumorphism.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Modern day websites are often comprised of the same flat minimalistic patterns,
                    you will be lucky to get anything but a simple shadow on an element.
                    While their content, layout, and images make them unique, the overall feel
                    is the same. Basically, every internet page looks like a page of a magazine.
                    That isn't bad in itself, but sometimes you just want to make something special,
                    something that doesn't feel like a flat sheet of paper.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That is where 3-dimensional designs shine, and neumorphism is one of them.
                    It combines gentle shadows and highlights with a calm color palette to create
                    a style that looks so appealing you can feel the touch even through
                    a computer screen.

                <h2>Neumorphism is a relatively unknown style</h2><br>
                <p>
                    I tried to dig up as much information as I could, however almost all of the
                    content related to this style describes the practical implementation rather than
                    its roots or history. Here is the summary of everything I could find.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Neumorphism, sometimes referred to as Soft UI, is defined by its light colors
                    and soft design. The latter describes the elements of a Neumorphic page,
                    that usually seem to blend into the page and
                    in some cases even dent into it. This makes them stand out from the other
                    3D designs which are typically built out of elements that seem to be floating
                    above the rest of the page's content. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For a bit more information, I recommend checking out
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neumorphism" class="text-link">
                    Neumorphism wiki page</a>,
                    although you won't really find much.
                </p>
        
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="outset-box glossy">
            <p>
                Most of the key elements of neumorphic design are attributed to Alexander Plyuto
                and his concept for a banking app. It is worth noting that the original designs
                are now being sold by the author as NFTs.
            </p>
        </div>

        <br>
        <hr class="outset-line">
        <br>

        <div class="outset-box glossy" id="p-technique">
            <h2>But how do we achieve the futuristic look?</h2>
            <p>
                The very basis of Neumorphism actually takes just a few CSS rules.
                The secret to the smooth look of a Neumorphic div is the
                juxtaposition of its shadow and its highlight
                on the side that's facing our imagined light source.
                Note that to create a clearly visible highlight, it has to be brighter than
                the page, so the latter is dimmed. The page you are looking at right now isn't
                white, it is grey. But in context that is almost unnoticeable.
        </div>
        <div class="flex-horiz">
            <div class="neu-image-display">
                <img src="Images/NEU-purple-cropped-2.jpg" style="height: 100%; width:auto;" alt="another Neumorphism example">
                <p class="image-attribution">
                    <a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/gradient-ui-ux-elements-collection_17742908.htm#query=neumorphism%20ui&position=0&from_view=search&track=ais">

            </div>
            <div class="outset-box glossy box-flex">
                <p>
                    Thus the basis of the design is established. If you were to implement these changes
                    and tweak the values to obtain the most natural look, you would have already
                    gained a sense of what does and doesn't fit the flow of the page. From there
                    it is only a matter of adding extra classes that match the general aesthetic.
                    I added buttons that have a slight inset when pressed, dimmed header displays
                    with glowing text, floating pill-like buttons and much more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, the more creative you try to be, the harder it gets to manage the CSS.
                    That rule is true for any project in general, but with Neumorphism it become
                    more noticeable. Its uniqeness comes at a price of two big hardships.

                <p>
                    You could not have missed a giant "Accessibility Mode" button plastered right
                    at the top of the page. The accessibility is indeed a problem more so than usual,
                    and adding the Accessibility Mode makes the code for each element much heavier,
                    especially if you want the mode to be toggleable. These are two major concerns
                    and are a part of the reason the style isn't used more extensively.
                    They are, however, solvable, and I will explore them and the solution in a separate
                    section.
